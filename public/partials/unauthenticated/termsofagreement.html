TERMS OF SERVICE



The following Terms of Service were last updated January 15th, 2016.



Thank you for using BlackMarket-U (“App and/or website”) by The Black Market University, LLC. You agree to this Terms of Service (“TOS”) by accessing the App, servers, websites, or content therefrom (together, “BlackMarket-U”).



LICENSE. If you are 18 or older, we grant you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive, nonassignable, nonsublicensable license to access BlackMarket-U in compliance with the TOU; unlicensed access is unauthorized. You agree not to license, distribute, make derivative works, display, sell, or "frame" content from BlackMarket-U, excluding content you create and sharing with friends/family. You grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, fully paid/sublicensable license to use, copy, perform, display, distribute, and make derivative works from content you post.

USE. You agree not to use or provide software (except for general purpose web browsers and email clients, or software expressly licensed by us) or services that interact or interoperate with BlackMarket-U, e.g. for downloading, uploading, posting, flagging, emailing, search, or mobile use. Robots, spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, etc. are prohibited, as are misleading, unsolicited, unlawful, and/or spam postings/email. You agree not to collect users' personal and/or contact information ("PI").

MODERATION. You agree we may moderate BlackMarket-U access and use in our sole discretion, e.g. by blocking (e.g. IP addresses), filtering, deletion, delay, omission, verification, and/or access/account/license termination. You agree (1) not to bypass said moderation, (2) we are not liable for moderating, not moderating, or representations as to moderating, and (3) nothing we say or do waives our right to moderate, or not.

DISCLAIMER. MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE LAWS PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND OTHER CONTRACT PARTIES, LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. WE RESPECT SUCH LAWS; NOTHING HEREIN SHALL WAIVE RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED.

To the extent permitted by law, (1) we make no promise as to BlackMarket-U, its completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, propriety, security or reliability; (2) your access and use are at your own risk, and BlackMarket-U is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE"; (3) we are not liable for any harm resulting from (a) user content; (b) user conduct, e.g. illegal conduct; (c) your BlackMarket-U use; or (d) our representations; (4) WE AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES ("BlackMarket-U ENTITIES"), DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES & CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; (5) BLACKMARKET-U ENTITIES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS (E.G. OF PROFIT, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL); (6) IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED $100 OR WHAT YOU PAID US IN THE PAST YEAR.

CLAIMS. You agree (1) any claim, cause of action or dispute ("Claim") arising out of or related to the TOU or your BlackMarket-U use is governed by Vermont ("VT") law regardless of your location or any conflict or choice of law principle; (2) Claims must be resolved exclusively by state or federal court in Burlington, VT (except we may seek injunctive remedy anywhere); (3) to submit to personal jurisdiction of said courts; (4) any Claim must be filed by 1 year after it arose or be forever barred; (5) not to bring or take part in a class action against BlackMarket-U Entities; (6) (except government agencies) to indemnify BlackMarket-U Entities for any damage, loss, and expense (e.g. legal fees) arising from claims related to your BlackMarket-U use; (7) you are liable for TOU breaches by affiliates (e.g. marketers) paid by you, directly or indirectly (e.g. through an affiliate network).

USER GENERATED CONTENT. By choosing to post, upload, discuss or make available any text, images, videos, postings, reviews, solutions or other content on BlackMarket-U, the user has created “User Generated Content” (“UGC”) and hereby grants a perpetual, royalty free, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, sub-licensable, and transferable right to copy, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish, publicly reform, publically display and use the UGC by any means as seen fit by BlackMarket-U administrators including making the content available for others to use and make derivative works. The user has entered agreement to grant these rights without a necessity for BlackMarket-U to seek further permission, or requiring restitution in any form. BlackMarket-U is not responsible for enforcing, or taking any disciplinary action in the claim of any violation of rights a user may claim to UGC by other users. In the occurrence of a dispute with another user of BlackMarket-U, the user accepts responsibility to contact the other user directly to find resolution. The user warrants that any UGC shall be their own original work and they shall not infringe.

PRIVACY.  BlackMarket-U reserves the right to retain data as needed for our business purposes and/or as required by law.

We make good faith efforts to store data securely, but can make no guarantees. Circumstances in which BlackMarket-U may disclose user data include but are not limited to:

•   to respond to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal process.

•   to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of users of BlackMarket-U or the general public.

•   with user consent (e.g. if you authorize us to share data with other users).

•   in connection with a merger, bankruptcy, or sale/transfer of assets.

•   in aggregate/summary form, where it cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

MISC. Users complying with prior written licenses may access BlackMarket-U thereby until authorization is terminated. Otherwise, this is the exclusive and entire agreement between us. If a TOU term is unenforceable, other terms are unaffected. If TOU translations conflict with the English version, English controls.
